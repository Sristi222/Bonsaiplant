                approaches to indoor plant
                growth and management. As an illustration, consider intelligent planters that keep an eye on soil
                moisture, light, and temperature, or hydroponic systems that automate plant nutrition and offer a
                regulated growing environment. Because
                of these technical developments, caring for indoor plants is now simpler and more widely available,
                which has helped the indoor plant industry expand. Lets learn more about the impact of technology in
